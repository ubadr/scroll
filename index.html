                <div class="col">
                    <p>Long ago, a wise philosopher observed the world around him and noticed that everything in the universe seemed to have a complementary opposite.</p>
                    <p>He called these opposites Yin and Yang. He believed that they were interconnected and interdependent, each containing a small piece of the other.</p>

            <section class="sec2 pin">
                <span style="font-size:40px" class="anim">࿊</span>
                <h1 class="anim">A Powerful Representation</h1>

                <div class="col anim">
                    <p>To symbolize the idea, he created the iconic Yin Yang symbol, with its black and white halves and smaller circles of the opposite color.</p>
                    <p>They represent the balance and harmony that can be achieved when these seemingly opposing forces work together.</p>
                </div>

            <section class="sec3 pin">
                <span style="font-size:40px" class="anim">࿊</span>
                <h1 class="anim">Finding Balance</h1>

                <div class="col anim">
                    <p>As the philosopher continued to study the world, he saw that everything had its own Yin and Yang energy, including human beings.</p>
                    <p>He believed that the key to a happy and fulfilled life was to find balance between these energies within oneself and with the world around them.</p>
